# Youtube-List-Downloader

It takes in a list of urls in a text file and downloads and extracts the audio into mp3's with youtube_dl and ffmpeg.

If you put a url of a playlist into the text file, it'll download the full playlist.

You can find ffmpeg here: https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html

And you can get youtube_dl here: https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl
